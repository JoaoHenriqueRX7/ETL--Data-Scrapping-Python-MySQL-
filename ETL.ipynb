    "# Car Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Project Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, I'm João Henrique. In this project, we'll explore a practical application of Python for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, focusing on car data. We'll extract information from various file formats, transform it, and load it into a database, showcasing Python's utility in data processing and database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Download and Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Download a zip file containing our data from a remote server.\n",
    "   - Extract the contents, which include CSV, JSON, and XML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Use Python's Pandas library and other tools to read data from each file format and create a uniform data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Perform currency conversion from USD to EUR on the extracted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Load**:\n",
    "   - Connect to a MySQL database and load the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query data**:\n",
    "   - Query the data from the Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project utilizes Python libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`, and `mysql.connector`.\n",
    "- For currency conversion, web scraping techniques are used to retrieve the latest USD to EUR conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting Up**:\n",
    "  - Ensure required Python libraries are installed.\n",
    "  - Download your Kaggle credentials and replace the placeholder in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running the Code**:\n",
    "  - The script is divided into functions, each handling a part of the ETL process.\n",
    "  - Run the entire script to see the ETL process or step through each function individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**:\n",
    "  - Logs are written to `log_file.txt`, useful for debugging or tracking.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this notebook, we define a set of constants that are crucial for the smooth execution of our script. These constants primarily involve paths and file names required for the data extraction, transformation, and loading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "- `URL`: The URL of the data source. This is the link to the zip file containing our datasets in various formats (CSV, JSON, XML).\n",
    "- `FILE_NAME`: The name of the file obtained from the URL. This helps us to dynamically assign the file name based on the URL.\n",
    "- `ZIP_FILE_PATH`: The path to the zip file that will be downloaded. We name the zip file as 'datasource.zip'.\n",
    "- `EXTRACTION_PATH`: The directory path where the contents of the zip file will be extracted. It is set to the current directory denoted by '.'.\n",
    "- `LOG_FILE`: The name of the file where we will log the operations and errors during the script's execution. It is essential for tracking the progress and debugging.\n",
    "- `TARGET_FILE`: The name of the final output file where the transformed data will be stored. In this case, it is named 'car_data.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining these constants at the beginning, we ensure that our script remains organized and easier to manage. It also allows for easier adjustments should there be changes in file paths or names."
